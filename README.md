# insurance-processing-app

This application calculates the cost of insurance for the customers of a fictional courier company. The application allows users to add orders to the database by filling in a form. Users are then taken to a confirmation page where they are given an order reference number. They can use this number to search for their order and see details about it on the search page.

This application is not yet complete. The request and response type is not JSON. In addition to this, the form validation is not yet fully operational as described by the business rules. The boolean value for insurance is also not appearing on the order details page.

I have created some boilerplate for unittests, but I have not actually written the tests yet. I also intend to write Selenium based front-end tests. I also intend to split the code up into modules to improve readability and organization.

The application can be ran from the api.py file.
