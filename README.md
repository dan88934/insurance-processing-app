# insurance-processing-app

This application calculates the cost of insurance for the customers of a fictional courier company. 

This application is not yet complete. The request and response type is not JSON. In addition to this, the form validation is not yet fully operational as described by the business rules.

I have created some boilerplate for unittests, but I have not actually written the tests yet. I also intend to write Selenium based front-end tests. 

The application can be ran from the api.py file.
